# How I Became a Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect

Becoming a **Google Cloud iCertified Professional Cloud Architect** was a journey filled with learning, hands-on practice, and a structured study plan. I wanted to share my experience in hopes it helps others pursuing the same goal as me.

## Why I Chose This Certification

My goal have been for the last years to become a fully fledge Solution Architect. But with parental leave etc some things had to be pushed to the future.

With the growing popularity of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, I decided that becoming a certified Professional Cloud Architect would not only validate my skills but also open new opportunities in cloud engineering and architecture.

## My Learning Strategy

I took a three-pronged approach to learning: **video-based training**, **Google‚Äôs official learning path**, and **practice exams**. Here‚Äôs how I broke it down:

---

### üé• Video Training with A Cloud Guru

This was my primary learning resource. The course, taught by **Joseph Lowrey**, is well-structured and provides a solid foundation for everything covered in the exam. I made sure to:

- Watch **all the videos** from start to finish
- Complete **every lab** for hands-on experience
- Go through the **quizzes** to test my understanding of each section

It was a fantastic way to get a comprehensive overview of GCP architecture concepts and services.

### üìò Google‚Äôs Official Learning Path

Once I completed the A Cloud Guru course, I wanted to dive deeper into some topics that weren‚Äôt fully covered. The official **Google Cloud learning path** filled those gaps. It includes whitepapers, in-depth documentation, and additional video content that complements other training materials.

This resource helped solidify my understanding of GCP‚Äôs best practices and architectural patterns.

### üìù Practice Exams with Udemy

Preparation wouldn‚Äôt be complete without **practice exams**. I used this Udemy course specifically for that purpose. Here‚Äôs how I approached it:

1. **First Attempt:** I took each practice exam without preparation, simulating a real test environment.
2. **Second Attempt (Next Day):** I revisited the same exam and analyzed my mistakes. This helped me see whether I truly understood the concepts and had improved.

This method significantly boosted my confidence and helped me identify weak spots before the actual exam.

## Tips for Success

If you're planning to take this certification, here are a few tips from my experience:

- **Don‚Äôt just memorize** ‚Äî aim to understand how GCP services fit together in real-world architectures.
- **Hands-on labs** are crucial ‚Äî theory alone won‚Äôt cut it.
- **Review your mistakes** in practice exams ‚Äî this is where the most learning happens.
- **Mix resources** ‚Äî no single course covers everything, so leverage multiple learning paths.
- **Recovery** - allow yourself some rest when studying.

## Final Thoughts

Passing the **Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect exam** wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. The certification has deepened my understanding of GCP and given me the confidence to tackle complex architectural challenges.

If you're thinking about taking this path, go for it. With the right resources and study strategy, it‚Äôs absolutely achievable.
