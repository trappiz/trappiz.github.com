Why I Chose This Certification

I wanted to share my experience in hopes it helps others pursuing the same goal as me.\nWhy I Chose This Certification My goal have been for the last years to become a fully fledge Solution Architect. But with parental leave etc some things had to be pushed to the future.\nWith the growing popularity of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I decided that becoming a certified Professional Cloud Architect would not only validate my skills but also open new opportunities in cloud engineering and architecture.\nMy Learning Strategy I took a three-pronged approach to learning: video-based training, Google‚Äôs official learning path, and practice exams. Here‚Äôs how I broke it down:\nüé• Video Training with A Cloud Guru A Cloud Guru: Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect Course\nThis was my primary learning resource. The course, taught by Joseph Lowrey, is well-structured and provides a solid foundation for everything covered in the exam. I made sure to:\nWatch all the videos from start to finish Complete every lab for hands-on experience Go through the quizzes to test my understanding of each section It was a fantastic way to get a comprehensive overview of GCP architecture concepts and services.\nüìò Google‚Äôs Official Learning Path Google Cloud Certification Learning Path: Cloud Architect\nOnce I completed the A Cloud Guru course, I wanted to dive deeper into some topics that weren‚Äôt fully covered. The official Google Cloud learning path filled those gaps. It includes whitepapers, in-depth documentation, and additional video content that complements other training materials.\nThis resource helped solidify my understanding of GCP‚Äôs best practices and architectural patterns.\nüìù Practice Exams with Udemy Udemy: Google Professional Cloud Architect - Practice Exams\nPreparation wouldn‚Äôt be complete without practice exams. I used this Udemy course specifically for that purpose. Here‚Äôs how I approached it:\nFirst Attempt: I took each practice exam without preparation, simulating a real test environment. Second Attempt (Next Day): I revisited the same exam and analyzed my mistakes. This helped me see whether I truly understood the concepts and had improved. This method significantly boosted my confidence and helped me identify weak spots before the actual exam.\nTips for Success If you‚Äôre planning to take this certification, here are a few tips from my experience:\nDon‚Äôt just memorize ‚Äî aim to understand how GCP services fit together in real-world architectures. Hands-on labs are crucial ‚Äî theory alone won‚Äôt cut it. Review your mistakes in practice exams ‚Äî this is where the most learning happens. Mix resources ‚Äî no single course covers everything, so leverage multiple learning paths. Recovery - allow yourself some rest when studying. Final Thoughts Passing the Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect exam wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. The certification has deepened my understanding of GCP and given me the confidence to tackle complex architectural challenges.\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about taking this path, go for it. With the right resources and study strategy, it‚Äôs absolutely achievable.\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions or need advice ‚Äî I‚Äôm always happy to help fellow cloud enthusiasts!\n","wordCount":"540","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://trappiz.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-04-09T15:30:13+01:00","dateModified":"2025-04-09T15:30:13+01:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Niklas Engvall"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://trappiz.github.io/blog/how-i-became-a-google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ENGVALL.IT","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://trappiz.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://trappiz.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://trappiz.github.io/logo.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://trappiz.github.io/about/about title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://trappiz.github.io/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://trappiz.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://trappiz.github.io/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How I Became A Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-04-09 15:30:13 +0100 +0100'>April 9, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Me, Niklas Engvall&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/trappiz/trappiz.github.com/content/blog/how-i-became-a-google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=how-i-became-a-google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect>How I Became a Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-i-became-a-google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect>#</a></h1><p>Becoming a <strong>Google Cloud iCertified Professional Cloud Architect</strong> was a journey filled with learning, hands-on practice, and a structured study plan.
